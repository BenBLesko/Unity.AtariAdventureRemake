# Atari's Adventure Remake
## CODE ONLY
### A 'Personal' project
Adventure, the 1979 video game for the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed Atari 2600) is often named as one of the industry’s most influential games. It is considered the first action-adventure and the first console fantasy game. While developer Warren Robinett’s secret room not the first such Easter Egg, thanks to the climax of Ernest Cline’s book and film adaptation, Ready Player One, Adventure has recently transcended into popular culture.
Since its initial release, Adventure has been officially re-released 13 times. 
Influenced by the film adaptation, Ready Player One and my on-going Game Design and Production course at Abertay University in Scotland, during the summer, I decided to re-create Adventure in Unity.
While I kept the essence of the original, Atari’s Adventure Remake is a 3D, top-down action-adventure game. While no new feature or item has been added to the game, I made some minor changes in the game mechanics; all of them are serving modernization purposes only.
